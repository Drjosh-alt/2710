Happy birthday, my love. From the very first moment I saw you, mh,🤔 when did i first meet you? Did we even meet? Owkey. lets go. Every glance from ur unique eyes makes the world brighter even with specs on, and every word you spoke carries a melody that lingers in my heart especially the voice yk.Your laughter is music, soft yet powerful and i mean very powerful 😅, filling every corner of the room🤭 or i mean  my soul with warmth and joy. I was endlessly amazed by your , your generosity, the way you treat everyone around you with and love and i could prove it trus me😶. Your intelligence inspires me every day; the way you think, the way you solve problems not math problems tho 🤭, the way you notice beauty in the little things around you makes me admire you more than words can express. Or things you do. 
You are graceful in subtle ways, profound ways, ways that captivate without effort. The way you move🤭  (everywhere), the way u speak, the way u listen with true attention shows a depth of soul I can't hardly describe. There is a perfection in your imperfection if you gerrit 😬, an elegance in the way you live your life. Your courage, the way you face challenges without complaint☺️, makes me want to be better, to rise to the same strength and calm you carry effortlessly. Even in moments of 🤷🏽‍♂️ yk, you carry a light that cannot be dimmed, a spirit that cannot be shaken, a heart that cannot be anything but generous and full of laav😍
Every detail about you seems placed by fate itself.  The way your hair 🤌🏽 jmn hair, my mdoly  the gentle tone of your voice, 😊 the way your hands express thoughts before words do🤭, I am endlessly captivated. You are beautiful not just in appearance but in essence, (" you dont need no other body " 🫢).in the countless little ways you show care, empathy, and undest..🫢. I could spend a lifetime observing you and still find new reasons to fall deeper in love with you each day. But..🤔   okay let me focus 😐😆 lifes short yk 

ur presence is comforting, ur smile healing, your love transformative like (beb beb optimus prime😯 ..wu wu 🫨ang ang🤪 ang )😅....okay okay focus😐..
...
You are perfection to me not because you are flawless, but because every part of your  squirt 🫢 😅 i mean your quirks, your laughter, your serious thoughts, your playful moments  all aligns perfectly with who you are who you want  to be yk according to your choice 🤷🏽‍♂️. My l
Appreciation, my admiration, my gratitude grows every day, believe it  and more  on this special day😁, I want you to know that to me, you are endlessly, infinitely beautiful, and wholly irreplaceable, as long as you are stil here 🤪......




I remember the first time we truly laughed together,  it was through texts tho 😅 how effortlessly our humor aligned and how the simplest jokes became moments of pure joy. We both have the same sense of humor. Laugh at the same stuff 😅 you made me a gossiper 🤣  start and kill streaks . C,  Every memory with you is jus vivid, painted with colors of happiness, warmth, and love. I remember our walks in the blazing sun 😅 everyone acting like its not hot enough  just to have more time with another 😅 , under da tree , yk a lot we walked 4.3 km talking remember 😅. I remember the quiet nights when we talked about everything and nothing 😅, sharing thoughts, dreams, fears, regrets. Those moments built the foundation of trust and connection and everything between that defines us 2day . If anyone asks its short but un explainable in detail.🫠  I remember the surprises, the spontaneous adventures ,gifts, and even the little slips that became inside jokes only we understood.🤭 Each experience with you has been a thread weaving the intricate tapestry, ( 🤭 hii vocabulary nime google  😅)... tapestry of our love.

 remember our late-night talks,  cuddles ..where we dreamed about the future, our hopes mingling effortlessly, painting a shared vision of a life together. I remember the comforting way you held me during tough days, tough nights🥹  i do have tough nights 😮‍💨..the warmth of your embrace that made worries and weeps  vanish. Every shared memory, no matter how small, has left a lasting imprint on my heart.🩶
 remember  little gestures that show who you are: the way you notice things others overlook, the way your eyes light up when you see beauty, the way your voice carries care even in simple words i notice that. I remember our celebrations, our quiet victories, and even the challenges we faced together, learning, growing, and becoming stronger as a pair ✌️. I remember the laughter that filled the  room. Esp that orange room 🤭. the smiles exchanged in silence, the gentle teasing that only deepened our bond. Each memory is a testament to the love, and understanding we’ve nurtured togther 
I remember the countless moments of tenderness, the shared meals 😋. When we turn ourselves to each other's meals🤤, the spontaneous hugs, the gentle words whispered at the perfect time let me not dive 😆. ..anyways Every memory we’ve created has been a gift, a chapter in the story of us, a reminder of how fortunate I am to share my life with someone like u. .....

All the secrets that keep me in chains, and
All the damage that might make me dangerous
You got a dark side, guess you're not the only one
What if we both tried fighting what we're running from?
